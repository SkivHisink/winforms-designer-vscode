## What is this?

VS Code has no native WinForms designer — to draw a `Form` you normally have to open Visual Studio. **WinForms Designer for VS Code** brings that designer surface into VS Code:

- Open a form's `Form1.cs` (with its generated `Form1.Designer.cs` sibling) and a **live preview of the rendered form** appears — exactly as Visual Studio shows the designer.
- **Click any control** to select it; a **property grid** and **toolbox** dock alongside the canvas.
- **Edit properties, drag/resize controls, align, set tab order, wire events** — changes are written back into `.Designer.cs` as **minimal, byte-surgical text edits** (the rest of your file is preserved byte-for-byte).

The rendering is real: a headless .NET host actually instantiates your controls (including custom/3rd-party ones) and paints them with their real `OnPaint`, so the preview matches runtime. The picture is captured at your display's device pixel ratio, so it stays **crisp on 4K / high-DPI** monitors. Two engines are bundled — a **.NET 10 LTS** engine for modern `.NET 8` / `.NET 9` / `.NET 10` projects and a **.NET Framework 4.8** engine for classic `net4x` / DevExpress projects — and each form is routed to the right one automatically.

## ✨ Features

- **Live form rendering** from `.Designer.cs` — full frame plus fast per-control dirty-region patches.
- **.NET Framework & DevExpress support** — `net4x` forms render on a bundled **.NET Framework 4.8** engine that interprets your **live source** (the Visual Studio model) onto the compiled controls (so DevExpress `XtraUserControl` & co. look pixel-accurate); the extension auto-routes each form to the right engine, and the property grid, drag/resize/align, add/remove, z-order, cut/paste, tab-page add/rename/delete, dropping the project's own vendor controls from the toolbox, and the collection editors apply live on the interpreted picture. A construct the interpreter can't yet reproduce falls back to a disclosed compiled render of the last build.
- **Visual Studio–style workflow** — opening `Form.cs` opens the designer; *View Code* switches back to text.
- **Property grid** — primitives, enums, and complex types (`Point`, `Size`, `Color`, `Font`, `Padding`, `Rectangle`, `Cursor`), composite expansion (`Size → Width/Height`), and standard-value dropdowns. VS-style **Color** (tabbed palette), **Font** (expandable name/size/style), **flags-enum**, **Anchor/Dock**, **Cursor**, and **image** editors. **Component-reference** properties (`AcceptButton` / `CancelButton`, `ContextMenuStrip`, `ContainerControl`, …) become a **dropdown** of the compatible sibling components — plus `(this)` for the form itself — and an `ImageList`-backed **`ImageIndex` / `ImageKey`** picks its image from a dropdown of the list's indices / keys. Non-default values are **bold**, a **description pane** explains the selected property, and a right-click **Reset** restores the default.
- **Collection editors** — the `…` button opens a Visual Studio–style **Collection Editor** for string collections (`ComboBox` / `ListBox` / `CheckedListBox.Items`), string-array properties (`TextBox.Lines`), `ListView.Columns`, `DataGridView.Columns`, and a recursive `TreeView.Nodes` tree editor (with per-node **images, check state, tooltip, and fore/back colors & font**) — on both engines. A panel **"Type Here"** editor also **reorders / adds / removes / renames** `MenuStrip` / `ToolStrip` items (with a context-appropriate item-type picker).
- **On-canvas menu & toolbar editing** — edit `MenuStrip` / `ToolStrip` items **directly on the strip**, Visual Studio–style: click the trailing **"Type Here"** slot to **add** (with a type picker), **double-click / F2** to **rename**, click to **select** and **Delete** — down through **nested submenus**, an **off-tree `ContextMenuStrip`** (from its tray chip), and the **overflow** area. Selecting an item opens **its own property grid** (with an **Events** tab), kept separate from the control selection. On **both** engines.
- **Images & `.resx`** — images stored in a form's sibling `.resx` are rendered in the preview; **import** or **clear** `Image` / `BackgroundImage` / `Icon`, and add, remove, reorder, or rename the keys of **ImageList** images. ImageList changes reconcile attached `ImageIndex` / `ImageKey` assignments in one undoable `.Designer.cs` + `.resx` transaction.
- **Layout panels** — edit `TableLayoutPanel` cells and column/row styles, `SplitContainer` splitter distance, and `FlowLayoutPanel` order, with anchor tethers drawn on the canvas.
- **Toolbox** — auto-populated from `System.Windows.Forms` (~39 controls in VS categories, with their native icons) plus controls discovered from project outputs, configured probe directories, browsed libraries, and registered .NET assemblies. **Choose Toolbox Items** scans libraries without instantiating controls, remembers chosen items and custom tabs across reloads, and uses the exact source assembly when adding a control or project reference.
- **Control sources** — pick which project (`.csproj`) or assembly (`.dll`) supplies your custom / 3rd-party controls; dropping a control from an unreferenced assembly offers to add the project reference.
- **Direct manipulation** — select, move, resize (8 handles), keyboard nudge (arrow keys), multi-select (Ctrl/Shift + rubber-band), group move/delete, reparent, z-order, copy/paste, **duplicate** (`Ctrl+D`), **lock controls**, align + distribute + make-same-size, tab-order editor, snaplines, on-canvas **smart-tags**, and a VS-style right-click menu.
- **Events** — describe, wire / unwire / rewire handlers, generate a handler stub, and navigate to the handler body in the `.cs` partner.
- **Component tray** & **document outline** (ARIA-accessible) for non-visual components and the control hierarchy.
- **Session continuity** — zoom, Lock Controls, the active designer tab, toolbox category state, outline state, custom toolbox tabs, and chosen items survive closing and reopening a form without modifying project files.
- **Localized UI (7 languages)** — the designer surface, dialogs and messages follow the `winformsDesigner.language` setting: English, Русский, 简体中文, Français, Deutsch, Español, हिन्दी.
- **Safe save** — edits are applied as targeted text splices guarded by representability and statement-diff gates; everything outside the changed span is preserved exactly (encoding/BOM included).
- **Zero-config assembly resolution** — finds your build output via MSBuild design-time evaluation (with multi-target support), or set an explicit assembly path.
- **Actionable diagnostics** — a degraded render names the affected target, cause, and statement while preserving the last good canvas as view-only; Retry, Rebuild, Choose Control Assembly, Copy Diagnostics, and Export Diagnostics provide direct recovery paths.

## 📦 Requirements

- **Windows x64** — the stable VSIX is published only as `win32-x64`; WinForms is Windows-only. Linux, macOS, WSL and Linux remote workspaces are not supported.
- **[.NET 10 Desktop Runtime, x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)** to run the primary engine. Building from source requires the .NET 10 SDK pinned by `global.json`.
- **.NET Framework 4.8** — for rendering `net4x` / DevExpress projects. The runtime ships with Windows; building the `engine-net48/` engine from source needs the .NET Framework 4.8 targeting pack.
- **VS Code** `^1.84`.
- A **trusted workspace** — see [Security](#-security--workspace-trust).

**Windows ARM64 is technically feasible, but is not a 1.0 target.** VS Code supports a separate
`win32-arm64` package and the modern engine can be published for `win-arm64`. Shipping it safely still requires
native ARM64 Extension Host/E2E coverage and a deliberate policy for the x64-only .NET Framework/vendor-control
engine (omit that feature on ARM64 or validate it under Windows x64 emulation). The 1.0 release therefore stays
single-architecture and fully tested on x64; no universal fallback VSIX is published.

## 🚀 Installing

Install from the **VS Code Marketplace** — search for **“WinForms Designer”**, or open the [Marketplace listing](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SkivHisink.winforms-designer-vscode).

> Requires **Windows x64** and the **.NET 10 Desktop Runtime** (see [Requirements](#-requirements)). The **.NET Framework 4.8 engine** (for `net4x` / DevExpress forms) renders your **live source** through an IR interpreter, with a disclosed compiled fallback for constructs it can't yet reproduce — see the [support matrix](#-support-matrix).

### Build & run from source

```bash
# 1. Build the .NET engine
dotnet build engine -c Release

# 2. Build the extension
cd extension
npm ci
npm run build
```

Then open the `extension/` folder in VS Code and press **F5**. A *Extension Development Host* opens on the `engine/samples` folder with all other extensions disabled. Open **`SampleForm.cs`** to see the designer.

See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for the full dev loop, tests, and architecture notes.

## 🧭 Usage

1. Open a form's **`Form1.cs`** (it must have a sibling generated **`Form1.Designer.cs`**). The designer opens automatically — like Visual Studio.
   - You can also right-click a `.cs` file → **Reopen Editor With… → WinForms Designer**.
2. **Click a control** on the canvas to select it. Use the **Properties** panel to edit values, or drag/resize directly.
3. Drop new controls from the **Toolbox**.
4. Press **F4** to focus the Properties panel; use **View Code** to switch back to the text editor.
5. **Save** (the toolbar Save button / `Ctrl+S`) writes minimal edits back into `.Designer.cs`.

### Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `winformsDesigner.autoOpenDesigner` | `true` | Open the designer automatically when a form's `.cs` becomes active. |
| `winformsDesigner.assemblyPath` | `""` | Explicit path to the built control assembly. Leave empty for auto-discovery; set it for multi-target / custom `OutputPath` / not-yet-built projects. |
| `winformsDesigner.net48.probeDirectories` | `[]` | Extra directories the **net48** engine searches for control assemblies it can't otherwise find — e.g. a 3rd-party control SDK installed outside the project's output and not in the GAC. The project's own output is always searched, so most projects need nothing here. Applies after a **Reload Window**. |
| `winformsDesigner.language` | `"en"` | UI language of the designer, dialogs and messages: `en` English, `ru` Русский, `zh-cn` 简体中文, `fr` Français, `de` Deutsch, `es` Español, `hi` हिन्दी. Chosen **here** (window scope) — it does **not** follow the VS Code display language. |

### Language

The designer surface, property grid, toolbox, dialogs and status / notification messages are localized and follow the **`winformsDesigner.language`** setting — seven languages: **English** (default), **Русский**, **简体中文**, **Français**, **Deutsch**, **Español**, **हिन्दी**. The language is picked in the extension settings, **not** from the VS Code display language, and switches **live** in already-open designer views. The VS Code **command palette** titles and the **settings page** itself follow VS Code's own *Display Language* (a platform limitation), so those pieces of chrome may stay in a different language until you **Reload Window** (you'll be prompted). Enum and color *values* stay canonical English so they remain typeable and round-trip cleanly.

## 🔒 Security & Workspace Trust

Rendering a designer **loads and runs your project's control assemblies** — control constructors and `OnPaint` execute when the preview is built. For that reason:

- The extension is **disabled in untrusted workspaces** (Workspace Trust).
- The engine **interprets `.Designer.cs` through strict allowlists** (only known-safe constructors, static calls, and property reads) — it does not execute arbitrary code from the file.

Only open projects you trust. To report a vulnerability, see **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**.

## 🗺️ Support matrix

**1.0 guarantees safe persistence.** Supported edits are written as **byte-local, conflict-checked** source splices; anything the designer can't persist safely is **refused with a stated reason**, never guessed. The **modern engine** renders your current source buffer. The **.NET Framework engine** interprets your **live source** (the VS model: parse `InitializeComponent`, instantiate the base type, replay onto the compiled controls), and its property panel + live edits re-derive from that interpreted picture; a construct it can't yet reproduce falls back to a compiled render of your **last build** with a **disclosed, named reason** — never a silent mismatch — and your source edits stay byte-local either way. See [Fail-closed by design](#fail-closed-by-design).

### Fail-closed by design

Rather than risk a bad regenerate, the designer refuses to whole-file-save (read-only, with a named reason) when a form is backed by **binary `.resx`** it can't reproduce, references an **unresolved base type**, or contains a **statement it can't represent** without loss. A **capability preflight** names the category — `safe` / `localizable` / `binaryResx` / `unresolvedType` / `lostStatements` / `unrepresentable` — so nothing regenerate-based ever guesses. On those forms, property and geometry edits still apply as **targeted byte-surgical splices**, which preserve everything outside the edited span. The one exception is a **`Localizable = true`** form (its layout lives in per-culture `.resx` via `ApplyResources`): that is **read-only outright**, because any edit here would diverge from the resources.

The **.NET Framework engine** renders your **live `.Designer.cs` source** through an IR interpreter — the Visual Studio model: parse `InitializeComponent` (never execute it), instantiate the form's base type, and replay the parsed statements onto the *compiled* control instances (so real net4x / DevExpress controls paint), and the property panel + live edits read and re-derive from that same interpreted picture. A construct the interpreter can't yet reproduce falls back to a compiled render of your *last build* with a **disclosed, named reason** (`unrepresentableStatements` / `unsafeBinaryResource` / `baseTypeChanged` / …) — never a silent mismatch, and the boundary is fail-closed (a hostile `.Designer.cs` can't run arbitrary code on open). It stays **fully editable**; safety comes from the byte-local splice.

### Not yet

`DesignerActionList` / vendor smart-tag action lists, advanced `.resx` (non-image resources, the full `ApplyResources` per-culture localization workflow), generic `IList<T>` collection editors, and RTL. These are **read-only-safe today** and tracked for post-1.0.

**`net4x` build coordination.** The preview renders a *real compiled instance* of your form and therefore loads your assemblies in place (shadow-copying would break delay-signed vendor controls). Use **WinForms: Run Build Task** / **Run Test Task** — `Ctrl+Shift+B` is routed through the coordinated build command while the designer is active — to release the output before the task, invalidate the compiled fallback, and re-render afterward. Build/test tasks launched elsewhere also trigger best-effort lifecycle coordination; **Release .NET Framework Assembly (for Rebuild)** remains available as a manual recovery control. The modern .NET engine interprets your source and does not pin the project output.

See the **[release roadmap](ROADMAP.md)** for the shipped 1.0 baseline, the concrete 1.1 daily-workflow and
project-integration milestone, the later 1.x milestones through enterprise localization in 1.5.0, and the
extensible design-time host planned for 2.0.0.

The safety core has fast C# and TypeScript unit coverage; the webview UI is validated headless (513 checks
across 133 tests), startup/render latency is guarded by a repeatable performance baseline, and activation,
engine startup, capabilities, and lifecycle diagnostics are smoke-tested in the real VS Code Extension Host on
VS Code 1.84 and current Stable. Found a rough edge? Please [file an issue](https://github.com/SkivHisink/winforms-designer-vscode/issues).
