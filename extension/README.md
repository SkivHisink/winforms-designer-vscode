# WinForms Designer for VS Code

**A Visual Studio–style WinForms form designer, running natively inside VS Code.**

Open a form's `Form1.cs` and get a **live, interactive preview** of the rendered form — click controls, edit properties, drag and resize, wire events, and save minimal changes back into `.Designer.cs`. No round-trip through Visual Studio.

> ⚠️ **Preview.** This extension is under active development. It requires **Windows** and the **.NET 9 SDK**. See [Status & limitations](#status--limitations).

## Features

- **Live form rendering** from `.Designer.cs` — your controls (including custom/3rd-party ones) are really instantiated and painted, so the preview matches runtime.
- **VS Code–native workflow** — opening `Form.cs` opens the designer; **View Code** switches back to text.
- **Property grid** — primitives, enums, complex types (`Point`, `Size`, `Color`, `Font`, `Padding`, `Rectangle`), composite expansion, and standard-value dropdowns.
- **Toolbox** — ~39 `System.Windows.Forms` controls plus controls from your own project assembly.
- **Direct manipulation** — select, move, resize (8 handles), multi-select + rubber-band, group move/delete, align toolbar, tab-order editor, snaplines.
- **Events** — wire / unwire / rewire handlers, generate a stub, navigate to the handler body.
- **Component tray** and **document outline** for non-visual components and the control hierarchy.
- **Safe save** — targeted, byte-minimal text edits; everything outside the change is preserved exactly.

## Requirements

- **Windows** (WinForms is Windows-only).
- **[.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)**.
- A **trusted workspace** (see below).

## Getting started

1. Open a form's **`Form1.cs`** (with its generated **`Form1.Designer.cs`** sibling). The designer opens automatically.
2. **Click a control** to select it, then edit it in the **Properties** panel or drag/resize it directly.
3. Add controls from the **Toolbox**; press **F4** to focus Properties.
4. **Save** to write minimal changes back into `.Designer.cs`.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `winformsDesigner.autoOpenDesigner` | `true` | Open the designer automatically when a form's `.cs` becomes active. |
| `winformsDesigner.assemblyPath` | `""` | Explicit path to the built control assembly. Leave empty for auto-discovery. |

## Security & Workspace Trust

Rendering a designer **loads and runs your project's control assemblies** (constructors and `OnPaint` execute on preview), so the extension is **disabled in untrusted workspaces**. The engine interprets `.Designer.cs` through strict allowlists rather than executing arbitrary code from the file. Only open projects you trust.

## Status & limitations

This is a **preview**. The core render → select → edit → save loop works; layout-parity polish, `UITypeEditor` modals, `.NET Framework` hosting, and advanced `.resx` are still in progress. Please report issues — the **WinForms: Export Designer Diagnostics** command generates a ready-to-paste bug report.
